This package is meant for extension developers and offers the ability to add task scheduling to Flarum.

## Use in your extension

The real deal is using it in your own extension. Simply require it in your extension `composer.json` file:

```json
    "require": {
        "fof/console": "^0.6"
    },
```

Now make sure the `ConsoleProvider` is registered inside Flarum. There's an Extender that helps you with that, inside
your `extend.php` add:

```php
return [
    new \FoF\Console\Extend\EnableConsole,
  // .. your code
];
```

## Task Scheduling, cron jobs

To set a schedule, create a [Service Provider](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/packages#service-providers) which
resolves the `Illuminate\Console\Scheduling\Schedule` through IoC, then use its methods to configure the schedule
for the command, see the [Task Scheduling documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/scheduling#defining-schedules).
